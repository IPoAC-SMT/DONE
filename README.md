# DONE - Docker Orchestrator for Network Emulation üê≥
![BANNER](https://github.com/IPoAC-SMT/DONE/assets/119054272/b0d4161b-ea38-4292-a987-6625e3d7a1b1)

**DONE** (_Docker Orchestrator for Network Emulation_) is a simple **network emulator**, inspired by the [IMUNES](https://github.com/imunes/imunes) project. Starting from the features IMUNES offered, we decided to recreate some of them, improving both software reliability and the UX while reducing software dependencies to the bare minimum.

## Prerequisites
In order for DONE to properly work, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- [`raylib`](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) for graphical purposes;
- [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to virtualize nodes and routers;
- [`openVSwitch`](https://www.openvswitch.org/) to virtualize switches.

You also need to make sure you have a C compiler on your machine, and the `make` utility.

### Installing openVSwitch on Debian/Ubuntu
To install openVSwtitch on Debian/Ubuntu, run the following comamnd:
```
sudo apt install openvswitch-switch
```

### Installing raylib on Debian/Ubuntu
To install raylib on Debian/Ubuntu, run the following commands:
```
sudo apt install libasound2-dev libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxcursor-dev libxinerama-dev libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev
cd raylib/src/
make PLATFORM=PLATFORM_DESKTOP RAYLIB_LIBTYPE=SHARED # To make the dynamic shared version.
sudo make install RAYLIB_LIBTYPE=SHARED
```

## Installation
To install DONE, simply clone the repository and navigate to the `DONE` folder, then run the `make` commands from there:
```
git clone https://github.com/IPoAC-SMT/DONE.git
cd DONE/Docker
docker build -t node:1.0.0 .
cd ../DONE
make clean
make
make exec
```

## Usage:
All the possible `make` options are the following:
```
make clean      # removes objects and executable
make exec       # if executable exists executes the GUI
make cli        # if executable exists runs the CLI
make            # compiles
make prod       # compiles and removes the intermediate files
make compile    # compiles the DoneScript files inside ./DONE/DoneScript/sources/
make import     # imports the DoneScript compiled files inside ./DONE/saves/
```
### Starting a simulation
Once you have created your topology, you can run the simulation by pressing on the **Start simulation!** button.
It is advisable to stop it via the **Stop simulation** button before closing the application, however everything will be deleted even if you do not stop it before exiting, therefore no pending docker containers will remain on your machine.

### Assigning configurations to a machine
When the experiment is running, click on the machine you desire to run commands onto with the right mouse button and its terminal will pop up.

### Saving configurations to file
Once the simulation is stopped and the project saved, clicking with the right mouse button on a machine will open its config file.

To assign configs to a machine, just write each command below the name of said machine, ending each command with a semicolon `;`.
Here is an example:

```
h-0:
ip addr add 10.0.0.2/24 dev sveth-h-0-s-1;
ip route add default via 10.0.0.1;

r-2:
ip addr add 10.0.0.1/24 dev sveth-r-2-s-1;
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.0.0.0/24 -j MASQUERADE;
```
An important note regarding the **names** when referring to **interfaces** in config files:
- if it is a **node** connected to a **switch**, the name of the interface starts with `sveth-` followed by the name of the node, a hyphen `-` and the name of the switch it is connected to (ex. `sveth-h-0-s-1` in the previous config file)
- if it is a **node** connected to a **node**, the name of the interface is `veth-` followed by the name of the node, a hyphen `-` and the name of the other node (ex. `veth-h-1-h-2`)

## DoneScript
`DoneScript` is the official **scripting language** for DONE.
It allows you to script topologies and configurations (instead of drawing them with the GUI and manunally filling config files, which is the standard approach) generating all the necessary files for you.
These files will be fully functional and ready to be opened in DONE for testing and visualisation.

All DoneScript files should be named without spaces and with the extension `.ds`.

Instructions are the following, where `shortname` is a string shorter than 20 chars, `x`, `y`, `r`, `g` and`b` are integers, `varname` is a shortname that begins with `var`. `command` can be any valid linux command.

```
create (host|router|switch|external interface|external natted interface|internet) at <x> <y> as <shortname>
link <shortname> and <shortname>
draw rectangle between <x> <y> and <x> <y> with color <r> <g> <b>
send command to <shortname> <command>
add text "a very long string I want to add" at <x> <y>

// you can comment things out, and it ignores empty lines as the ones around it

// YOU CAN ALSO WRITE EVERYTHING IN UPPERCASE!

for <varname> in (host|router|switch|external interface|external natted interface|internet)
do
    // you can write here any instruction, even other loops! wonderful, isn't it?
done
for <varname> in <min> <max> step <step>
do
    // whatever you want
done
```
### How to use it
1. Create a `.ds` file in the directory `Donescript/sources`
2. To compile it, run `make compile` (this command will compile all the `.ds` files under the `Donescript/sources` directory
3. To make your project visible to DONE and therefore openable from the GUI there are two different approaches:
   - To only import one project: take the `.done` and `.done.conf` you need (the ones with the same name as the `.ds` file you just filled) from the directory `Donescript/compiled` and move them manually in the directory `DONE/DONE/saves`
   - To import all projects: run `make import`
5. Open your project in DONE as usual

## Command Line Interface
The CLI is an instance of `python3` with network emulation functions which offers the possibility to interact with the underlying network infrastructure by using a simple command line instead of the graphical interface.
To use the CLI instead of the GUI, as said earlier, launch DONE with the following `make` command:
```
make cli
```
